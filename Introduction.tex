\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
A group authenticated key exchange %(\introGAKE) protocol allows a group of users to agree on a shared session key in the present of an active adversary. It extends the \introAKE protocol from 2-party to $n$-party setting. Similar to the security requirements of 

\subsection{Our Contribution.}
How magnificent have we been?

Our efficiency $\approx$ $3\times $ BD, but much less than the Sign-GAKE (2*Sign + 3*Ver) per user.

\subsection{Related Work.}
There will be a lot to write about here, at least comparing efficiency.

\subsection{Roadmap.}
Going through the paper highlighting section by section.
